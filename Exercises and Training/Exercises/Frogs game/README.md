# Frogs game project
## Exigency
Write an algorithm that solves the frog game:
- Given a series of two different types of frogs and spaces solve the puzzle
- The left set of counters can only move right, the right set of counters can only move left.
- Counters can move forward one space, or move two spaces by jumping over another counter.

## Features

- Have a base config set in Start.py
- Different sources to get the input
- Different recursive and non-recursive solutions to solve the problem
- Select whether to see the processing process
- Select if and where to save the process
- It sets the final state and verifies its feasibility

## Tech

#### Start.py
The Start.py file contains all the methods for entering the request configuration files

#### Core.py
The Core.py is the file that contains all the methods for data processing

#### End.py
The End.py file contains the final methods for running the program
