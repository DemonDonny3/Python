# Puzzle jumping frogs project
## Exigency
Write an algorithm that solves the puzzle of jumping frogs:
- Given a series of two different types of frogs and spaces solve the puzzle
- The left set of counters can only move right, the right set of counters can only move left.
- Counters can move forward one space, or move two spaces by jumping over another counter.

## Features

- Have a base config set in Start.py
- Different sources to get the input
- Different recursive and non-recursive solutions to solve the problem
- Select whether to see the processing process
- Select if and where to save the process
- It sets the final state and verifies its feasibility
